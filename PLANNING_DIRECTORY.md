## Time/Priority Matrix

[Here](https://res.cloudinary.com/dcrioc0sw/image/upload/v1600053229/Screen_Shot_2020-09-13_at_11.12.47_PM_gpdozj.png) is a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. 
The MVP list includes functionality that will be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

- Hamburger menu/Navigation Bar (mobile-first)
- Sign In Modal
- Log In Modal
- Input Expenses Modal
- Vue.js
- Footer

#### PostMVP

- About, Contact, etc. for the footer
- Sort by category
- Logo
- User profile

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections, try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions. Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
